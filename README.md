# Undergraduate Student Studying Mechanical Engineering and Astrophysics 


### Education
Michigan State University, Bachelors of Science, Mechanical Engineering 2022-Present
Concentration in Biomedical Engineering
Focus in Astrophysics

### Professional Experience
Research and Assembly Intern, Wisconsin IceCube Particle Astrophysics Center
- Directed with assembling 205 multi-PMT Digital Optical Modules (mDOMs) for the IceCube Neutrino
Observatory, part of a cleanroom lab completing assembly under a strict schedule and quality control process.
The completion will enhance neutrino event detection and enhance the observatory's scientific capabilities,
contributing to the $4.1 million upgrade
- Simulated Cherenkov light and Antarctic conditions operating a class 3B laser and ultra-low temperature (ULT)
walk-in freezer and analyzed data regarding the light detection functionality of the mDOMs at temperatures as
low as -40Â°C
- Conducted diagnostic and automation tests on mDOMs by utilizing a Linux based testing framework and editing
Python, Bash, and C++ . Completing over 400 experiment runs over a period of 7 months
- Wrote 2 extensive documents outlining the responsibilities of each final compliance testing member, used to
help onboard 15 new lab members and taught introductory Linux/Unix, Python, and C++
